## UX

### Site Goal:

To provide a fun game for people looking to get a prediction on a question submitted with the possibiity of a yes/no answer.
To provide a clear layout with intuitive user controls and clear user feedback.

### Existing User Goals:

- As an existing user: I want to be able to find get predictions to multiple questions with different responses each time.

### New User Goals:

- As a new user: I want to be able to find a fun game to predict the outcome of a future event.

## Design

### Color Scheme
The color scheme chosen is a simple black and white, with the ability to toggle between dark and light modes for the body and fonts to make the site easily readable.
A radial gradient containg shades of grey was chosen for the circular answer div to give the impression of a crystal ball with the text appearing in black.

### Typography

The Google font [Rajdhani](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rajdhani?query=Rajdhani) was chosen for the site with a fallback of Sans-Serif.
The unusual look of the font adds an element of mysteriousness while also having a clean appearance and high readability.
